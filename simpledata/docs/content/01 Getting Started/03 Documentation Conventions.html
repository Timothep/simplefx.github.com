<h2>Documentation Conventions</h2>
<p>For the sake of brevity, all code snippets in the documentation assume that there is a variable <strong>db</strong>
  which was returned from one of the Simple.Data Database.Open...(...) methods.</p>
<p>Unless explicitly mentioned, all code snippets which run an operation against the database will also show the SQL
generated by that code using the ADO adapter and the SqlServer provider. Obviously Simple.Data is not just a SQL
wrapper, but this convention should be most easily understood by the widest audience.</p>
<p>In the 'Generated SQL' code, parameters will be shown as simple assignments before the SQL in which they are used.
This is just a convenient shorthand notation and not valid SQL. At runtime in the ADO adapter, parameters are handled
through the

  collection.</p>
