<h2>Freqeuently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Inevitably, when learning a new data access technique (even a lightweight intuitive one like Simple.Data) there are
areas that diverge other common frameworks. This tends to lead to the same question popping up, so we've grouped some answers
here. 
</p>

<h3>How do I see the generated provider specific operations for my Simple.Data operations?</h3>
<p>The documentation here focusses on Sql Server for consistency, but this means we may have not documented quite how
something works for a different provider. Each provider is responsible for its own syntax generation and in order to 
gain access to the generated querying operations (for example) in Sql Lite, you can simply attach a System.Diagnostics
TraceListener. Simple.Data will output to the TraceListeners all generated provider specific syntax as it is run.
</p>

<h3>Capitalised Objects</h3>
<p><i>My database schema contains a convention of all objects being in uppercase. This makes my .net code seem quite SHOUTY 
when I use Simple.Data! Help!
</i>
</p>

<p>Simple.Data is able to resolve capitalised SHOUTY database schemas form the differently cased equivalents. If your database
table is CUSTOMER, the following holds true:
</p>
<h4>Simple.Data:</h4>
<pre class="brush: csharp">
_db.Customer.All().ToList();
</pre>
<h4>Generated SQL:</h4>
<pre class="brush: sql">
    select [dbo].[CUSTOMER].[CUSTOMER_ID] from [dbo].[CUSTOMER]
</pre>

<h3>Schema fever</h3>
<p><i>My tables are in different schemas... how do I express the statement "select * from [foo].[bar]" where foo is a 
schema and bar is a table?</i></p>
<p>Simple.Data supports schemas. Try this:</p>

<h4>Simple.Data:</h4>
<pre class="brush: csharp">
_db.foo.bar.Find(_db.foo.bar.Id == 1);
</pre>
<h4>Generated SQL:</h4>
<pre class="brush: sql">
@p1 = 1
select [foo].[bar].* from [foo].[bar] where [foo].[bar].[id] = @p1
</pre>
